## Overview

If there is a particular form of R Markdown document that you or those you work with create frequently, it may make sense to create a re-usable document template for it. R Markdown templates are typically re-distributed within R packages, and can be easily discovered from within RStudio using the **New R Markdown** dialog:

Note that if you are not using RStudio you can also create new documents based on templates using the `rmarkdown::draft` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::draft("my_article.Rmd", template = "jss_article", package = "rticles")
```

## Template Basics

R Markdown templates should be located within the `inst/rmarkdown/templates` directory of an R package. The minimum files required for a template are:

**Directory:** `inst/rmarkdown/templates/my_template`

```bash
template.yaml 
skeleton/skeleton.Rmd 
```

The contents of the two files might look like this:

**template.yaml**

```yaml
name: My Template
```

**skeleton/skeleton.Rmd**

```markdown
---
title: "Untitled"
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    fig_caption: true
---

## Overview

## Analysis

```

This is a trivial example that simply overrides a couple of the default parameters of `html_document`. You could of course also include additional document structure, logo elements, stylesheets, etc. 

## Supporting Files

If want to include supporting files with your template they should be placed in the `skeleton` directory. These files will be automatically copied alongside new documents. For example, if your template included a standard logo and stylesheet it contain the following:

**Directory:** `inst/rmarkdown/templates/my_template`

```bash
template.yaml 
skeleton/skeleton.Rmd 
skeleton/logo.png 
skeleton/styles.css 
```

**template.yaml**

```yaml
name: My Template
create_dir: true
```

**skeleton.Rmd**

```markdown
---
title: "Untitled"
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    fig_caption: true
    css: styles.css
---

```

Note the use of the `create_dir` field in the template definition to indicate that a new directory should be created when documents are created from the template (this is a default that the user can override).

## Custom Formats

When creating a template it's also convenient to create a [custom format](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/new-formats.html) that is used by the template. Custom formats are useful when you have lots of supporting files or want to constrain the output options to a set of invariants established by the format. 

Here's an example of a custom format based on `html_document`:

```{r}
quarterly_report <- function(toc = TRUE) {

  # get the locations of resource files located within the package
  css <- system.file("reports/styles.css", package = "mypackage")
  header <- system.file("reports/quarterly/header.html", package = "mypackage")

  # call the base html_document function
  rmarkdown::html_document(toc = toc,
                           fig_width = 6.5,
                           fig_height = 4,
                           theme = NULL,
                           css = css,
                           includes = includes(before_body = header))
}
```

This format could then be used in a template follows:

```yaml
---
title: "Untitled"
output: mypackage::quarterly_report
---
```

See the article on [Creating New Formats](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/new-formats.html) for additional details on custom formats.

## Examples

### Package Vignette

The [Package Vignette](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-package-vignette.html) format provides an example of a format that customizes the base [`html_document`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) format with custom CSS and some other tweaks related to vignette authoring. The source code for the Package Vignette [format](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/blob/master/R/html_vignette.R) and [custom template](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/tree/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/html_vignette) are a good starting point for creating your own HTML based formats.

### rticles Package

The [rticles](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles) package includes three examples of templates (all of which have an associated custom format):

1) [JSS article](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/tree/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/jss_article)

2) [R Journal article](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/tree/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/rjournal_article)

3) [useR abstract](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/tree/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/use_r_abstract)

Both of these use custom LaTeX templates to produce output that conforms to the document standards of JSS and useR.
