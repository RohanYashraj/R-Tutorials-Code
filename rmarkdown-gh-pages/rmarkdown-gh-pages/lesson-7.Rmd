By default, R Markdown displays data frames and matrixes as they would be in the R terminal (in a monospaced font). If you prefer that data be displayed with additional formatting you can use the `knitr::kable` function, as in the .Rmd file below. This file is available [here](https://rstudio.cloud/project/181946) on RStudio Cloud.

Note the use of the `results='asis'` chunk option. This is required to ensure that the raw table output isnâ€™t processed further by knitr.
