R Markdown renders to four presentation formats:

* [beamer_presentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/beamer-presentation.html) - PDF presentations with beamer
* [ioslides_presentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/ioslides-presentation.html) - HTML presentations with ioslides
* [slidy_presentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/slidy-presentation.html) - HTML presentations with slidy
* [powerpoint_presentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/powerpoint-presentation.html) - PowerPoint presentation
* [revealjs::revealjs_presentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/revealjs.html) - HTML presentations with reveal.js

Each format will intuitively divide your content into slides, with a new slide beginning at each first or second level header.

Insert a horizontal rule (`***`) into your document to create a manual slide break. Create incremental bullets with `>-`, as in the .Rmd file below, which is available [here](https://rstudio.cloud/project/181959) on RStudio Cloud.
