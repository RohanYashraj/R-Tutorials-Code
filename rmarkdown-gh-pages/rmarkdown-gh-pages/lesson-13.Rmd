Render collections of R Markdown documents into a website with the `rmarkdown::render_site` function. Each .Rmd file becomes a page of the site. Here we build a website from [these files](https://rstudio.cloud/project/181978) available on RStudio Cloud.

Each website requires 

* a file named `_site.yml`, which provides the global YAML header for the site
* a .Rmd file named `index.Rmd`, which provides the content for the home page of your website.

Execute the `rmarkdown::render_site` function from within the directory containing your files to build `_site`, a directory of files ready to deploy as a standalone static website.

Better yet, create an [RStudio Project](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects) for your directory. RStudio will add a Build tab to the IDE that you can use to build and preview your site.
