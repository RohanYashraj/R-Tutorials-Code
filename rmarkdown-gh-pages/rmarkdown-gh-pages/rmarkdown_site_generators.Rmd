The behavior of the default site generation function (`rmarkdown::default_site`) is described in the article on [Creating a Website](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html). It is also possible to define a custom site generator that has alternate behavior. 

## Site Generator Function

A site generator is an R function that is bound to by including it in the "site:" field of the "index.Rmd" or "index.md" file. For example:

**index.Rmd**

```markdown
---
title: "My Book"
output: bookdown::gitbook
site: bookdown::bookdown_site
---
```

A site generation function should return a list with the following elements:

name 

:    The name for the website (e.g. the parent directory name).

output_dir

:    The directory where the website output is written to. This path should be relative to the site directory (e.g. "." or "_site")

render 

:    An R function that can be called to generate the site. The function should accept the `input_file`, `output_format`, `envir`, `quiet`, and `encoding` arguments.

clean 

:    An R function that returns relative paths to the files generated by `render_site` (these files are the ones which will be removed by the `clean_site` function.

Note that the `input_file` argument will be NULL when the entire site is being generated. It will be set to a specific file name if a front-end tool is attempting to preview it (e.g. RStudio IDE via the Knit button).

When `quiet = FALSE` the `render` function should also print a line of output using the `message` function indicating which output file should be previewed, for example:

```r
if (!quiet)
  message("\nOutput created: ", output)
```

Emitting this line enables front-ends like RStudio to determine which file they should open to preview the website.

## Examples

See the source code of the [`rmarkdown::default_site`](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/blob/master/R/render_site.R#L157) function for an example of a site generation function.

The **bookdown** package also implements a custom site generator via it's [`bookdown::bookdown_site`](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/blob/master/R/site.R) function.
