## Introduction to R

This repository collects tutorials on the use of R. The tutorials use historical data from the correspondence of Daniel van der Meulen in 1585. The data is a subset of a larger digital history project, information about which you can find [here](https://jessesadler.com/project/dvdm-correspondence/).

The tutorials come from blog posts on https://www.jessesadler.com. The R markdown documents in this repository are used to create the posts. Each post also has an R script, which contains all of the code from the posts in a more compressed format.

If you have any comments, please let me know in the issues.
